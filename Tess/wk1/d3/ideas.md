### Ideas for object

## Pokemon

- name
- type
- height
- weight
- evolve method could act on name height and weight?
- wait a second dumbass evolution doesn't add a certain amount to height and weight -_-
- I guess you could pass the amounts - it doesn't need to be accurate....
- convert height and weight to imperial?

## Genes

- name
- locus
- DNA length
- mRNA length - several types.... Doesn't need to be accurate
- protein length?

Nah..... I don't think I can make a useful array out of this
